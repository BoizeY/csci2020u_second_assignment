=== Project Files ===

Download the repo using the green download button.
The client and the server are contained in separate projects and folders.
The projects can be opened in ItelliJ and compiled / ran through that IDE.



=== Executables ===

Alternatively, there are .jar files for both projects. They are contained in the /out/artifacts/*_jar/ folders. Each project has this file structure contained in it.



=== Running the Server ===

Create a terminal in the folder with the server .jar. 
Use the following command [java -jar Main.jar] to run it.
The shared folder where the files are stored is in this directory.



=== Running the Client ===

The client makes use of command line arguments so to run it, use the following syntax when in the correct directory [java -jar Main.jar "PC Name Here" "Path/To/Directory/Here"]

The folder that is passed in can be any directory but there is a pre-made LocalFolder that can be found in the same location as the client .jar.
